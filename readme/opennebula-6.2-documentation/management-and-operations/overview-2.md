# Overview

### How Should I Read This Chapter[¶](broken-reference)

In OpenNenbula there are two main places where VM disk images are stored:

* [Marketplaces](broken-reference), these are shared locations across multiple OpenNebula clouds. They can be public or for private use. Marketplaces store Marketplace Applications (or Appliances), that includes the application definition together with the disk images.
* [Datastores](broken-reference), these are the local storage areas of a cloud. They typically refer to storage clusters or hypervisor disks and are mainly devoted to store disk [Images](broken-reference).

In these chapter you will learn how to operate effectively these entities.

### Hypervisor Compatibility[¶](broken-reference)

These guides are compatible with all hypervisors.
