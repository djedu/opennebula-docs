# Overview

A **Host** is a server that has the ability to run Virtual Machines and that is connected to OpenNebula’s Front-end server. To learn how to prepare the Hosts, you can read the Open Cluster Deployment guide. Hosts are usually grouped in **Clusters**.

### How Should I Read This Chapter[¶](broken-reference)

In this chapter there are four guides describing these objects.

* **Host Management**: Host management is achieved through the `onehost` CLI command or through the Sunstone GUI. You can read about Host Management in more detail in the [Managing Hosts](broken-reference) guide.
* **Cluster Management**: Hosts can be grouped in clusters. These clusters are managed with the `onecluster` CLI command or through the Sunstone GUI. You can read about Cluster Management in more detail in the [Managing Clusters](broken-reference) guide.

You should read all the guides in this chapter to familiarize yourself with these objects. For small and homogeneous clouds you may not need to create new clusters.

### Hypervisor Compatibility[¶](broken-reference)

These guides are compatible with all hypervisors.
